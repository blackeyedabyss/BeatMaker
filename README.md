# BeatMaker
This is an awesome small project, which I created from scratch using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript. It is a beatmaker, with 3 rows of pads, with a kick sound, a snare sound and a hi-hat sound!

This project features a tempo slider as well, which will enable the end user to decide the tempo range from 20 bpm to 300 bpm, the user can select between a gamut of sounds present in the sounds directory.
